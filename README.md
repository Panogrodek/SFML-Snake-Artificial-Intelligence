# Snake Artificial Intelligence
*A simple snake game, that is controled by **Generic Algorithm Neural Networks.***

**You can find two versions:**
1. Raw version that is just a square looking for apples,
2. Polished one that truly resembles the Snake game.

## Raw version
![Sequence 01_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97810330/163857136-45bc5b23-b64c-4336-946e-2757410fe321.gif)
As you can see this version is only to demonstrate how Neural Network behaves.
The code is more transparent for people, that want to learn how this algorithm works.

## Polished version

This version is a fully functional snake game, with AI implemented. You can try it for yourself, or have the AI do the work.
Less transparency here, but the code is finished in this version.
